## Use it for your own project


This project still under active development. There will be NPM package published later.
For now, you can install using the commit hash to include the package to your own `package.json`.

For example:

```
TBD
```

You may find the latest commit hash at https://github.com/MO-Movia/licit/commits/master

In order to upload image work correctly, "images" folder is expected outside the root folder 'licit'.
